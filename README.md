# DISCLAMER

###  All my exams are now over, and I will be starting college soon. I do not know how much free time I will have, and I don't know if I want to keep working on this project. I won't make any promises, but I don't want to make the same mistake of keeping something on the backburner while many people are interested in it. This was my first big open-source project and I have learned a lot from maintaining it. I was going to update it to Material 3, but I am so tired and have lost my edge. Sorry, everyone but I am archiving this project because I have found some good alternatives such as https://www.beercss.com/ and https://www.svelteui.org/. Goodbye and thanks for enduring my tardiness.
